The value of the Romanian exports to Canada amounts to USD 17.55 million, and the value of imports of USD 9.10 million. At the level of the whole year 2017, according to the Romanian statistics, the total trade was 341.8. USD million, of which USD 213.5 million represented Romanian exports (an increase of 82% compared to 2016) and USD 128.3 million represented imports (an increase of 58.2% compared to 2016).\n\nCanada ranks 29th among the top foreign investors in Romania in terms of subscribed share capital.\n\nRegarding the structure and territorial orientation of Canadian investments in Romania, most of the joint ventures are active in the electronic industry, the light industry, auto constructions and spare parts, the agri-food sector, transport, construction, metal manufacturing, tourism, being mainly located in Bucharest, Bihor, Dolj, Bistrita Nasaud, Brasov, Arad, Harghita, Alba, Cluj, Prahova, Salaj, Iasi counties.\n\nAccording to the Romanian National Statistic Institute, the real estate market is also growing in Bucharest - http://www.bucuresti.insse.ro/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Locuin\u0163e-terminate-\u00een-Municipiul-Bucure\u015fti-\u00een-anul-2018.pdf\n\n\nAccording to the last media data, the demand for renting by expats raised in 2018 with 30% to 40% - http://www.bucuresti.insse.ro/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Locuin\u0163e-terminate-\u00een-Municipiul-Bucure\u015fti-\u00een-anul-2018.pdf\n\nMany of this demand are in the north part of Bucharest and the prices per month vary between 700 and 1000 EUR/Month; a modest amount compared with Western Europe average real estate prices; according to this statistic references - https://www.statista.com/statistics/503274/average-rental-cost-apartment-europe/\n\nSo renting an apartment in Bucharest is much cheaper (up to 50%) compare to top EU cities but 30 to 40% of the demand goes to the northern part of Bucharest, which is well known for its infrastructure problems like - lack of sewerage, secondary access roads, bad public transport, crowded traffic, etc (for more info please read this article - https://www.wall-street.ro/articol/Real-Estate/238183/dan-cristian-popescu-suntem-mult-in-urma-cu-infrastructura-in-dimitrie-pompeiu.html#gref).\n",
